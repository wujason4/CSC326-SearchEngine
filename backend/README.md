How to run run_backend_test.py

1. Make sure working directory is ../backend
2. In one terminal, run command "python mybottle.py"
3. In another terminal with same working directory, run command "python run_backend_test.py"

Note:
    - Test pages are self made and on localhost
    - Did not implement multithreading, so have to run localhost on one terminal and tester on another
