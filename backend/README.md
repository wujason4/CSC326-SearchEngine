How to run unit test:

1.Go to directory <PROJECT_PATH>/lab1_group_1/backend

2.Run command "python mybottle.py"

3.Run command "python unit_test.py"

Note: 
- unit_test.py will use both test_page1.txt and test_page2.txt, containing the URLs the crawler will crawl through 
- these URLs are created when running the mybottle.py
